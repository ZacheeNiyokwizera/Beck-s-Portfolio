            <p>Rebecca has been working with
              our team since
              September. It has been an absolute
              pleasure,
              and I have
              personally witnessed how the team has grown, including myself.

              Our team is a remote team, but Rebecca was able to help us overcome the challenges of not always being in
              the
              same vicinity. Communication channels were smoother, and she helped create opportunities for connection.

              The retrospectives held have been very valuable in improving honest and open conversations between all of
              us;
              revealing issues before they become bigger and unsolvable; and we have been able to collectively adapt our
              processes as a team.

              I have recommended her to numerous people and will continue to do so.

            <p>Rebecca came up to our offices in Joburg for two days: she presented an “Introduction to
              Agile” to our
              offices; had various 1:1s with our heads of departments and had two different retrospectives with
              our
              different teams.

              Everyone responded very positively to the experience, the sessions were productive and fruitful.

              I was given a whole new perspective on my teams and I was able to hear their needs differently. The
              experience
              led to valuable changes in our processes and a new coffee machine for the staff!

            <p>I am a copywriter for Kuja Kuja, and am currently learning how to code as well. I helped
              Rebecca create this
              website.

              I have known her since September. She brings laughter, fun and lightness into the office. She helped
              me
              set
              goals
              and motivated me to achieve them. We are able to voice
              our concerns and feelings in 1:1s with her and in retrospectives.
