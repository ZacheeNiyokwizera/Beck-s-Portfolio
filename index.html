      <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
      <p>I was born in England back in the day.
        I moved to Cape Town. (Some things happened in-between) . I am still in Cape Town.
        I started a group called “F*ck the Cape town Clique” to promote pro-social behaviour and to do cool stuff with
        cool
        people.
        When I am not traveling, and being social, I
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-tara-cameron-b7278114b/" style="color:peru"> work</a>
        I am a qualified attorney and finished my articles of Clerkship at <a
          href="https://www.cliffedekkerhofmeyr.com/en/index.html" style="color:peru"> CDH.</a>
        I then did what a millennial does and changed careers inspired by discussions at
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/lean-startup-coffee/" style="color:peru">Lean (Startup) Coffee.</a>
        I got to work for one of South Africa’s most awesome start-ups called

        <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/" style="color:peru"> OfferZen </a> and learned about the Tech World.
        That is when I discovered what a <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master"
          style="color:peru">Scrum
          Master</a> is (jokes – I still do not know what it is).
        I now work with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/campey/" style="color:peru"> Dave</a>, the guy that started
        Lean (Startup)
        Coffee at Afrolabs as a Legal Advisor and Agile
        Facilitator.
        I have started a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lean-Legal-Coffee/" style="color:peru">Lean (legal) coffee </a>
        hosted at
        <a href="https://www.cliffedekkerhofmeyr.com/en/index.html" style="color:peru"> CDH.</a> for
        people connected in any way to the legal industry.
        I am also on the committee for <a href="https://sugsa.org.za/" style="color:peru">SUGSA</a> and we organise cool
        <a href="https://sugsa.org.za/" style="color:peru">Meetups</a> <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bnj30zy5c" style="color:peru">and so many
          activities </a> for
        people somehow
        involved in
        Agile.
        I now introduce Agile into non-tech environments and facilitate external meetings.
        My favourite meeting is a <a href="#" style="color:peru"> retrospective.</a>
        Here are some of the <a href="#" style="color:peru">cool things </a> people have said about this with some
        photographic imagery of
        cray cray
        times.
        I would love to visit your office because I love meetings and coffee.
        I have a more <a href="#"></a>detailed CV if you are interested in that sort of thing.
        Here is the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2YCT2EQXRxPqcT3ZGgP0cr?si=hAvgd5RuSVq4FfiSnjYByg"
          style="color:peru"> sound
          of my voice </a> in this podcast that I did about Agile in the legal industry.
        <a href="#" style="color:peru"></a>Call me.
