      <p>I was born in England back in the day.
        I moved to Cape Town. (Some things happened in-between) . I am still in Cape Town.
        I started a group called “F*ck the Cape town Clique” to promote pro-social behaviour and to do cool stuff with
        cool
        people.
        When I am not traveling, and being social, I work.
        I am a qualified attorney and finished my articles of Clerkship at CDH.
        I then did what a millennial does and changed careers inspired by discussions at Lean (Startup) Coffee.
        I got to work for one of South Africa’s most awesome start-ups called OfferZen and learned about the Tech World.
        That is when I discovered what a Scrum Master is (jokes – I still do not know what it is).
        I now work with Dave, the guy that started Lean (Startup) Coffee at Afrolabs as a Legal Advisor and Agile
        Facilitator.
        I have started a Lean (legal) coffee hosted at CDH for people connected in any way to the legal industry.
        I am also on the committee for SUGSA and we organise cool meetups and so many activities for people somehow
        involved in
        Agile.
        I now introduce Agile into non-tech environments and facilitate external meetings.
        My favourite meeting is a retrospective.
        Here are some of the cool things people have said about this with some photographic imagery of cray cray times.
        I would love to visit your office because I love meetings and coffee.
        I have a more detailed CV if you are interested in that sort of thing.
        Here is the sound of my voice in this podcast that I did about Agile in the legal industry.
        Call me.
